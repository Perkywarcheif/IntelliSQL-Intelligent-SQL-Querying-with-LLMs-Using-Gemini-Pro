# 🚀 IntelliSQL: Intelligent SQL Querying with LLMs Using Gemini Pro

## 📌 Overview

**IntelliSQL** is an AI-powered web application that converts natural language queries into optimized SQL statements using **Google Gemini Pro (LLM)**. The system enables users to interact with databases effortlessly without requiring deep SQL knowledge.

Users can type questions in plain English (e.g., *“Show students who scored above 80 marks”*), and IntelliSQL automatically generates, validates, and executes the corresponding SQL query, returning accurate results instantly.
